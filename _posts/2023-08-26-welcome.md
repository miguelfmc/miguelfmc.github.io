# Welcome

...to my very modest blog.

While I do have a non-technical [blog](https://minitations.wordpress.com/), I've been thinking of blogging about what I consider, broadly, my "field", for quite some time.

In a way, I'm kicking this off to keep myself somewhat disciplined with my own learning journey in the very often overwhelming world of machine learning.

Here you'll mainly find short to medium posts on machine learning, Python, statistics, probability and applied math in general.

Hope you like it!
