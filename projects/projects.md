# Projects

## Review and Comparison of Methods for Subset Selection in Linear Regression

In this project, I compare several statistical learning methods that aim to solve, either exactly or approximately, the best subset selection problem in linear regression.

A detailed description of the project nd my results can be found [here](subset-selection.md).

## Characterizing Behavioral Changes in Energy Use

In this project, done in collaboration with the Berkeley-Singapore Building Efficiency and Sustainability Program, a group of Berkeley grad students and I analyze the change in energy consumption in a particular office building after different energy-saving strategies.

A detailed description of the project can be found [here](energy-savings.md).

## Deep Learning for Lip Reading

In this project, still in progress, a fellow Berkeley graduate student and I implement neural network architectures in order to transcribe videos pf people speaking to text, in other words, *lip reading*.

A detailed description of the project can be found [here](lip-reading.md).
