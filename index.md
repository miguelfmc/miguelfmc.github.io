I am a recent graduate from the **Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of California, Berkeley**.
Prior to my studies in Berkeley I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering at the **Technical University of Madrid**.

My main interests lie in the areas of statistical learning and optimization, and I am looking to develop my career as a data scientist in the Bay Area.

In this website you will find my main personal projects and resume.

Projects
============

### Forecasting Energy Demand in California

In this series of notebooks I analyze the hourly electricity load for PG&E, a Californian utility company, and develop models to forecast electricity demand.

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](1_CaliforniaEnergyDemandEDA.html)
2. [Long-term Energy Forecasting with Prophet](2_LoadForecastingWithProphet.html)
3. Short-term Energy Forecasting with GAMs

### Review and Comparison of Subset Selection Methods for Linear Regression

In this project, I compare several statistical learning methods that aim to solve, either exactly or approximately, the best subset selection problem in linear regression.

A detailed description of the project and my results can be found [here](subset-selection.md).

### Characterizing Behavioral Changes in Energy Use

In this project, done in collaboration with the Berkeley-Singapore Building Efficiency and Sustainability Program, a group of Berkeley grad students and I analyze the change in energy consumption in a particular office building after different energy-saving strategies.

A detailed description of the project can be found [here](energy-saving.md).

### Deep Learning for Lip Reading

In this project, still in progress, a fellow Berkeley graduate student and I implement neural network architectures in order to transcribe videos pf people speaking to text, in other words, *lip reading*.

A detailed description of the project can be found [here](lip-reading.md).
