I am a recent graduate from the **Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of California, Berkeley**.
Prior to my studies in Berkeley I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering at the **Technical University of Madrid**.

My main interests lie in the areas of statistical learning and optimization, and I am looking to develop my career as a data scientist in the Bay Area.

In this website you will find my main [personal projects](projects/projects.md) and [resume](resume/resume.md).
