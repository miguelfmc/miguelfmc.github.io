I am a recent graduate from the Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at University of California, Berkeley.
Prior to my studies in Berkeley I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid.

My main interests lie in the areas of statistical learning and optimization, and I am looking to start my professional career as a data scientist in the Bay Area.

In this website you will find my main [personal projects](projects/projects.md), [contact info](contact.md) and [resume](resume/resume.md).
