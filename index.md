I am a recent graduate from the **Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of California, Berkeley**.
Prior to my studies in Berkeley I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering at the **Technical University of Madrid**.

My main interests lie in the areas of statistical learning and optimization, and I am looking to develop my career as a data scientist in the Bay Area.

In this website you will find my latest personal projects and resume.

Latest Projects
============

### Bayesian Data Analysis Mini-Case Studies

Recently, I have been learning the basics of Bayesian inference and I am creating a series of "explainers" to share what I believe are some of the key concepts in Bayesian stats in a visual way

1. [A gentle introduction to Bayesian inference - Part 1](projects/LogisticRegression-Part1.html)

### Forecasting Energy Demand in California

In this series of notebooks I analyze the hourly electricity load for PG&E, a Californian utility company, and develop models to forecast electricity demand.

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](projects/1_CaliforniaEnergyDemandEDA.html)
2. [Long-term Energy Forecasting with Prophet](projects/2_LoadForecastingWithProphet.html)
3. [Short-term Energy Forecasting with GAMs](projects/3_LoadForecastingGAMs.html)

### Review and Comparison of Subset Selection Methods for Linear Regression

In this project, I compare several statistical learning methods that aim to solve, either exactly or approximately, the best subset selection problem in linear regression.
Here you can download the full [paper](https://github.com/miguelfmc/subset-selection/raw/master/MiguelFMC_Project_SubsetSelection.pdf) and here you may find the [code](https://github.com/miguelfmc/subset-selection/).
