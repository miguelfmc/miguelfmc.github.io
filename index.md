I am a **Machine Learning Scientist at PayPal** as well as a recent graduate from the **Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** at the **University of California, Berkeley**.

My main interests lie in the areas of statistical learning and optimization. I love learning about all things data, engineering, ML and decision science. Bay Area resident and always happy to connect!

In this website you will find my latest personal projects and resume.

Latest Projects
============

### Shellper AI: Command Line Tool with Click + OpenAI API

I wanted to get my feet wet with the OpenAI API and leverage the power of their GPT models, so I built a quick-and-dirty CLI (with the help of ChatGPT) that will help you find the Linux shell commands that you need for your tasks, right from the command line.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/miguelfmc/shellper-ai).

### Subset Selection Methods for Linear Regression

I recently implemented a simple but quite interesting method for subset selection in regression as a [scikit-learn compatible package](https://github.com/miguelfmc/sklearn-discretefirstorder).

This work was inspired by one of my old grad school projects, in which I compared several statistical learning methods that aim to solve, either exactly or approximately, the best subset selection problem in linear regression.
Here you can download the full [paper](https://github.com/miguelfmc/subset-selection/raw/master/MiguelFMC_Project_SubsetSelection.pdf) and here you may find my [original code](https://github.com/miguelfmc/subset-selection/).


### Bayesian Data Analysis Mini-Case Studies

Recently, I have been learning the basics of Bayesian inference and I am creating a series of "explainers" to share what I believe are some of the key concepts in Bayesian stats in a visual way

1. [A gentle introduction to Bayesian inference - Part 1](projects/LogisticRegression-Part1.html)
2. [A gentle introduction to Bayesian inference - Part 2: Monte Carlo and MCMC](projects/LogisticRegression-Part2.html)

### Forecasting Energy Demand in California

In this series of notebooks I analyze the hourly electricity load for PG&E, a Californian utility company, and develop models to forecast electricity demand.

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](projects/1_CaliforniaEnergyDemandEDA.html)
2. [Long-term Energy Forecasting with Prophet](projects/2_LoadForecastingWithProphet.html)
3. [Short-term Energy Forecasting with GAMs](projects/3_LoadForecastingGAMs.html)
